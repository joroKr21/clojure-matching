# clojure-matching

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joroKr21/clojure-matching.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/joroKr21/clojure-matching)

A minimalistic pattern matching library for Clojure.

This library is intended as a proof of concept. It shows the power of Clojure
and its extensibility. The implementation of a fully functional, albeit not
particularly efficient, pattern matching library is possible in ~250 lines of
code.

If you are interested in actually using pattern matching in Clojure, you should
take a look at [core.match](https://github.com/clojure/core.match).

## Usage

For now, take a look at some tests.
